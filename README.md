Profile of Michael Welch
============

Summary
-------

I have 19 years of development and IT experience and 3 years of formal leadership experience. I bring a unique mix of skills as I've contributed, led, mentored and taught. I have an educational background in engineering, computer science and business.

My passion is for developing clean quality code and
for mentoring others to do the same. I stay sharp by doing independent reading, 
contributing to projects on GitHub, creating my own personal study projects,
taking university courses, and facillitating study groups.

I have 3 years of agile experience. 

Career
-------------

### Johnson Controls ###

I've worked on many releases and features of building automation system and security & fire systems over 13 years. The majority of 
that experience involved the following technologies: C#, Java, Sql Server,
web services. 

#### Highlights ####

* Implementation of binary serialization framework in Java and C# 
* Introducing unit testing, refactoring, and clean coding through mentoring, code reviews, and study groups 
* A language for expressing constraints and a compiler for generating code to enforce them 
* State machine engine 
* Team member on MMS (a distributed communication protocol and related set of application services) 
* Team lead for reusable controls for Graphics+ project  
* Bringing in distributed source control 

#### P2000 User Interface ####

Technical lead of the P2000 user interace team. The team consisted primarily of consultants all of us new to the P2000 product. My role included high level design, mentoring a team of 7, implementation, and code reviews. Technologies used were HTML5, JavaScript, and ASP.Net MVC.

#### Graphics+ Feature ####

For two years I served as the technical lead for our Graphics+ feature of our
building management system. The tool allows a customer to build "smart"
graphics to monitor and command their building control system. Required
the creation of 300 custom WPF/Silverlight controls. These controls also needed
to work seamlessly in a layout tool (think Blend) and allow these controls to be bound to real-time information (thermostats, damper positions, etc.)


### SysLogic ###

I was a Senior Consultant. I developed in Visual Basic, C# and Sql Server for various clients. 

### Procter & Gamble ###

I was a Systems Analyst. My responsibilities included requirements analysis, project management, system support and some development for ERP type systems: production planning, material purchase planning, and warehouse utilization planning.

Management Experience
--------------------

I was promoted to engineering manager a year after forming the P2000 Web UI team.
My biggest contribution as manager was to recruit the best employees from within JCI.
They've been given considerable freedom and have exceeded my expectations.

Teaching Experience
---------------

I have taught two courses at Milwaukee School of Engineering: Data Structures and Software Development I.

On the Web
---------

My blog is at [loominate.net](http://loominate.net). There I occasionally write about software development, computer science and math.

I have many repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/michaelgwelch) and 
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/myklwelch). Favorites include [mbasic99](https://github.com/michaelgwelch/mbasic99) (a compiler for TI BASIC), [brainmess](https://github.com/michaelgwelch/brainmess) (a simple interpreter useful for refactoring study groups), [parser.js](https://github.com/michaelgwelch/parser.js) (a functional parser library in JavaScript) and [loominate.net](https://github.com/michaelgwelch/loominate.net) (my blog).

I've asked and answered a handful of questions on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/697188/michael-welch)


Hobbies
--------

In the last couple of years I've taken an interest in physical fitness: I've recently completed my first two half-marathons, a Rugged Maniac and a Tough Mudder. I'm currently training for my first marathon.

I enjoy keeping up with tech industry and read several blogs related to C#, Swift, Haskell, functional programming, and Apple.

I enjoy studying math (for example, [abstract algebra](https://bitbucket.org/myklwelch/algebra/src)) and learning new programming languages (Haskell, JavaScript and Swift being the most recent).
