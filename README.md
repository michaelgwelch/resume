I'm looking for a challenging position in software development. My strength is in data access and data transformation code written in C#. I'm looking for an opportunity eventually in mobile and web development.

I bring a unique mix of skills as I've contributed, led, mentored and taught. I have an educational background in engineering, computer science and business.

My passion is for developing clean quality code that is easily maintained and enhanced; while employing a just enough approach: With my educational background I have a passion for the theoretic; but I appreciate the constraints of a schedule and good enough. Note: good enough does not mean shoddy quality. It means not over-designed.

Who am I
-------

Favorite Language: Haskell

Favorite Tool: git/GitHub

Markdown, Latex

Prefer strongly typed languages (probably because of my academic interests in type systems), but can appreciate the loosely typed like JavaScript (I guess because I'm fascinated by the lambda calculus)

A few of my scribbles can be found at loominate.net

I've answered a few questions at StackOverflow.

I've got some code at github.com/michaelgwelch (Some good, some not so good). I'd love to explain to you which is which and why I feel so. (Contributed a little to other projects, very minor. Always interested in doing more.)

I was even published once in an early edition of Visual Studio Magazine.


Work Experience
-------------

### Johnson Controls ###

I've had various titles at Johnson Controls. I started as a software engineer and had several career progression promotions. Most recently I served as an engineering manager.

#### Engineering Manager ####

Recruited, assembled, and managed a team of 5-10 developers and testers for 2 years. This role actually started as I was the technical lead for this team.

My goal as an engineering manager was to be a technical engineering manager and would consider this an ideal position for me. If such a position isn't available I'd rather be a contributor and technical leader/mentor.

#### Senior Staff Engineer ####

#### Staff Engineer ####

#### Principal Engineer ####

### SysLogic ###

* Senior Consultant 1999 - 2002 *

### Procter & Gamble ###

* Systems Analyst *

Education

Hobbies
--------

In the last couple of years I've taken an interest in physical fitness: I've recently completed my first two half-marathons, a Rugged Maniac and a Tough Mudder. I'm currently training for my first marathon.

I enjoy keeping up with tech industry: favorite blogs: functional programming, apple blogs, etc.

Enjoy new languages and proof languages (see twelf, coq)
