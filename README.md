Michael Welch
============

I'm looking for a challenging position in software development. My strength is
in data access and data transformation code written in C#. I would like an 
opporunity to work on mobile and/or web development. I've done a little of each.

I bring a unique mix of skills as I've contributed, led, mentored and taught. I
have an educational background in engineering, computer science and business.

My passion is for developing clean quality code that is easily maintained and
enhanced; while employing a just enough approach: With my educational
background I have a passion for the theoretic; but I appreciate the constraints
of a schedule and good enough. Note: good enough does not mean shoddy quality.
It means not over-designed.

Work Experience
-------------

### Johnson Controls ###

I've had various titles at Johnson Controls. I started as a Principal Engineer (software)
and had several career progression promotions. Most recently I served as an
engineering manager.

#### Web UI for security product ####

I've wroked on several releases of the same product for 3.5 years (October 2011 - present) developing a new web user interface for our P2000 Building Security system.

In the first 9 months I was responsible for forming the team, selecting
tool-chain and process, high-level design, and ultimately delivering the first
release of the new user interface. The backend was written in C# and 
used ASP.Net MVC stack. The frontend was written in HTML5 targetting modern browsers. Key libraries used were jQuery and Knockout.

I was promoted to engineering manager soon after this period and my role became
more one of recruting, management, and mentoring. I'm proud of the achievements my team achieved during this time: TDD (high unit test coverage), BDD (they championed it, while I had to smooth over the initial fears that this was taking too much time), simulator to facillitate BDD, the use of virutal machines for build servers, automated
test servers, demo servers, etc. We also released 2 more versions of the UI.

#### Graphics+ Feature ####

For two years I served as the technical lead for our Graphics+ feature of our
building management system. The tool allows a customer to build "smart"
graphics to monitor and command their building control system. Required
the creation of 300 custom WPF/Silverlight controls. These controls also needed
to work seamlessly in a custom layout tool (think Blend) and allow these controls to be bound to real-time information (thermostats, damper positions, etc.)

The team I lead grew to be over 20 people working on the controls, the editor, runtime data-access, etc. The technology was C# and WPF/Silverlight and accessing real-time data thru web services and historical data from SQL.

#### Previous Projects ####

Served in various roles on various releases/features for the building management system for the rest of the 7 years. 


### SysLogic ###

I was a Senior Consultant from 1999 - 2002. I developed in Visual Basic, C# and Sql Server for various clients. I also did project management for one project.

My last client assignment was for Johnson Controls working on the first release of building automation system. Based on the quality of my work, I was hired as a permanent employee.

### Procter & Gamble ###

I was a Systems Analyst from 1992 - 1997. Primary duties included requirements analysis, project management, system support and some development for ERP type systems: production planning, material purchase planning, and warehouse utilization planning.


### Milwaukee School of Engineering ###

I have taught two courses at MSOE: Data Structures and Software
Development I. 

Who am I
-------

Favorite Language: Haskell

Favorite Tool: git/GitHub

Markdown, Latex

Prefer strongly typed languages (probably because of my academic interests in type systems), but can appreciate the loosely typed like JavaScript (I guess because I'm fascinated by the lambda calculus)

A few of my scribbles can be found at loominate.net

I've answered a few questions at StackOverflow.

I've got some code at github.com/michaelgwelch (Some good, some not so good). I'd love to explain to you which is which and why I feel so. (Contributed a little to other projects, very minor. Always interested in doing more.)

I was even published once in an early edition of Visual Studio Magazine.


Education
-----------

M.S. Computer Science, University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee

M.S. Business, University of Wisconsin - Madison

B.S. Electrical Engineering, University of Wisconsin - Madison

Hobbies
--------

In the last couple of years I've taken an interest in physical fitness: I've recently completed my first two half-marathons, a Rugged Maniac and a Tough Mudder. I'm currently training for my first marathon.

I enjoy keeping up with tech industry: favorite blogs: functional programming, apple blogs, etc.

Enjoy new languages and proof languages (see twelf, coq)
